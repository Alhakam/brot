# BROT - Bridge Topology Ontology
*This repo has been moved from the original wisib server to github*

The Bridge Topology Ontology (BROT) allows the definition of bridge constructions including aggregated zones and components as well as their topological relations. The ontology supports a generic modeling approach and therefore could be applied for any bridge type (e.g. suspension bridge or girder bridge). BROT can be subdivided into multiple components and zones, whereby also common zones such as the superstructure and substructure are supported. Furthermore, BROT allows the definition of joints and coatings as well as object properties for describing the vertical relation between two components or zones.

The namespace for BROT terms is `https://w3id.org/brot#`

The suggested prefix for the BROT namespace is `brot`

BROT is based on the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) and therefore reuses various classes and properties from it.
