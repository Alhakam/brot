<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span> The Bridge Topology Ontology (BROT) allows the definition of bridge constructions including aggregated zones and components as well as their topological relations.
  	The ontology supports a generic modeling approach and therefore could be applied for any bridge type (e.g. suspension bridge or girder bridge). <a href="#Bridge">brot:Bridge</a> can be subdivided into multiple components (<a href="#BridgeElement">brot:BridgeElement</a>) and zones (<a href="#BridgeSpatialZone">brot:BridgeSpatialZone</a>), whereby also common zones such as the superstructure (<a href="#BridgeSuperstructure">brot:BridgeSuperStructure</a>) and substructure (<a href="#BridgeSubstructure">brot:BridgeSubstructure</a>) are supported. Furthermore, BROT allows the definition of joints (<a href="#BridgeJoint">brot:BridgeJoint</a>) and coatings (<a href="#BridgeCoating">brot:BridgeCoating</a>) as well as object properties for describing the vertical relation between two components or zones.</span>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for BROT terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org/brot#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the BROT namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">brot</span>
  </p>
  <span> BROT is based on the Building Topology Ontology (<a href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot/">BOT</a>) and therefore reuses various classes and properties from it.</span>
